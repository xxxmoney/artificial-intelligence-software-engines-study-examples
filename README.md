# Study examples for school subject Artificial Intelligence and Software Engines

# About

 - Mashup of examples to help (me) learn the subject AISE
 - Is mainly consisted of simple, naive-implementation examples

# Contents
  - src - here are the folders for each category
    - In root folder, there are several python files used across the examples
      - tree.py - an easy to use implementation of tree for game states
      - game_state.py - basic "interfaces" for game states
      - tic_tac_toe_simple - a simpler simple implementation of tic tac toe - used for MINIMAX, MCTS, etc
    - 01_number_representation - issues with representing very precise numbers using floating point - IEEE 754
    - 02_game_search - how is the game (its states and moves) represented and what algorithms are there to go through it
    - 03_behavior - how the NPC behavior is made - how to define rules for NPC to react to certain circumstances
    - 04_neural_network - how neural networks (comprised of interconnected neurons) work and can be used to creating complex NPC/game-decision behavior
